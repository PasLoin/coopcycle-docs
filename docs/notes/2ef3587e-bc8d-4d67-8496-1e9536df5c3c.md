# Admin

## Admin access

Having admin access means your local coop has an instance on the CoopCycle platform (e.g.: <https://awesomecoop.coopcycle.org>)

If you have admin access it means your user account on your [CoopCycle](https://coopcycle.org/en/) instance has been given admin privileges by the developer. 

## Admin privileges

Admin privileges means you have full control over your CoopCycle instance. 

Check the sub-categories under **Admin** to learn more about your instance.
