How to use the App as a Restaurant.
</div>

## Log in

See [Log in](/en/app/install/#log-in).

As soon as you **Log in** the app will display the main screen where all Orders are managed. 

The Order screen refreshes automatically, meaning it will notify instantly when New Orders comes in. When Orders are **accepted**, **collected**, **completed** or **cancelled** they will instantly move to the respective category.

### Main screen

This screen displays:
- A date picker from which you can select any past or future date. 
- The <span class="badge badge-success"> <i class="fa fa-sync"></i> Today</span> button which refreshes the Main screen.
- Five (5) tabs for Orders. More on this below.
- The <span><i class="fa fa-power-off" aria-hidden="true"></i> </span> button closes the restaurant on the current day.
- The <span><i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> </span> button is the Settings screen of the Restaurant. More on this [here](/en/app/restaurant/#settings-screen).

<span class="badge badge-info">TIP:</span><span> If you here the notification of a New order but cannot see it on your screen, it means the Order is for a date in the future, make sure to click on the date with the calendar <span><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> </span> icon and choose a date.</span>

When a New Order comes in a notification pop-up will be displayed. You can close this.
The new order will be displayed under **New orders**. 
To **Accept** the Order, you must click on it and Swipe right on the button at the bottom.
### Order screen
- A <span class="badge badge-secondary">Print</span> button which allows you to print a receipt of the Order. On how to connect a printer to the app, see [here](/en/app/bluetooth-printers/).
- The customer's telephone number.
- The Order items.
