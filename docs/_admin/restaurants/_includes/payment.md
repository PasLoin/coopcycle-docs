In the **Payment** section you will find two **Connect with Stripe** buttons. One for **Test** and another for **Live** mode. You should connect **Test** mode first and make Test payments to make sure the Restaurant and Stripe account of the restaurant are configured correctly. 

Go to [Creating a Stripe account](/en/admin/restaurants/creating-a-restaurant/#creating-a-stripe-account) to begin setting up the account.
