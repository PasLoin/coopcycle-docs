# Stores

<div class="alert alert-" role="alert">
Stores, also known as <em>Backoffice</em>, are accounts without an e-commerce output. They allow businesses to create deliveries and don't handle payments.

## Create a Store

1. Click on <span class="badge badge-success"> <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Create a new store</span>
2. Fill in the fields in **General** and **Settings** tabs from the left.
   
   ### General
   #### **Name**
   Type the name of the store.

   #### **Legal name**
   Type the legal name of the store.

   #### **Website**
   Type the website of the store

   #### **Telephone**
   Type the Telephone of the store.

   ### Settings

   #### **Pricing**
   Choose a pricing that corresponds for each Store. As Stores don't handle payments, the Pricing is mostly used for record-keeping and invoicing (the latter is done outside the platform).

   See here on how to [create a pricing](/en/admin/deliveries/pricing/).

   #### **Additional settings**

   <div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded border border-warning">
   <span class="badge badge-warning">IMPORTANT:</span>
   <span> Make sure to check ☑️ the <strong>Create orders</strong> option. This will allow store owners to create orders.</span>
   </div>

   - Pre-fill automatically pickup address will fill in the store address each time a store owner creates a delivery.
   - Require input of weight will make the **weight** field mandatory when creating an order.
   - Require input of packages will make the **packagess** option mandatory when creating an order.
  
   #### **Time slot**
   Choose a time slot that corresponds for each Store. 

   See here on how to [create a time slot](/en/admin/deliveries/timeslots/).

   #### **Package set**

   Choose a package that corresponds for each Store.

   See here on how to [create a package](/en/admin/deliveries/packages/).
   
   #### **Tags**

   A store tag is different than a task tag. Choosing a tag for a Store will automatically place the tag to both tasks when a delivery is created.

   See here on how to [create a tag](/en/admin/deliveries/tags/).
