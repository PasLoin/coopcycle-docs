# Stores

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
In CoopCycle's "vocabulary", a <strong>Store</strong> represents a B2B customer, i.e. a professional merchant to whom the cooperative offers its delivery services.<br><br>
Basically, a <strong>Store</strong> is a container for deliveries.<br>
Users can be attached to a <strong>Store</strong>, and once attached, they can use the web interface to order deliveries using a form.
The deliveries ordered this way land directly in the dispatch.
