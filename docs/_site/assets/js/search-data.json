Authentication is implemented by sending a JSON Web Token via HTTP headers. Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt; . Authenticating as a web application . If you are creating a web application that does not need to act on behalf of a user, you need to use the OAuth client credentials flow to obtain an access token. Obtaining API credentials . To create access tokens, you will need API credentials (an API key and an API secret). Ask the platform administrators to create a API application and send you the API credentials. Using the credentials to obtain an access token . The first step to make authenticated requests is to obtain an access token. To obtain an access token, you first need to make a request to the /oauth2/token endpoint, with your API credentials encoded as Base64. Here is an example to encode your API credentials using PHP: . php -r 'echo base64_encode(\"&lt;api_key&gt;:&lt;api_secret&gt;\"), PHP_EOL;' . Here is an example request to the /oauth2/token endpoint using cURL: . curl -X POST -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&amp;scope=tasks+deliveries' -H 'Authorization: Basic &lt;base64_credentials&gt;' https://acme.coopcycle.org/oauth2/token . The response should look like this: . { \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"expires_in\": 3600, \"access_token\": \"&lt;access_token&gt;\" } . Using the access token to make authenticated requests . You can now use the access token to make authenticated requests to the API . curl -X POST -d '{ ... }' -H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer &lt;access_token&gt;' https://acme.coopcycle.org/api/deliveries .

As part of the creation of a store account, it is possible to create prices (e.g. express prices, normal prices) from the administration section by clicking on the icon then on the Prices section. [screenshot] . Pricing is configured in the administration dashboard through a set of rules based on the following variables: The distance that is measured in meters. This distance can be defined with the operators of: . | &gt; greater than _ variable in meter _ | &lt; less than _ variable in meter _ between two variables | . The weight which is evaluated in gram. This weight can be defined with the same operators as the distance The zone defined by loading a GeoJSON file into the instance configuration; The type of bike that is defined by selecting it from a list in which are available: The simple bike The cargo bike . [screenshot] . These rules are organized as a stack in order of processing, the pricing at the top of the list will be the first to be processed by the software that will check if it matches the characteristics of the delivery, that is not the case the software will go to the second pricing in the list and so on. With each delivery created, this stack will be used to create the pricing. The choice is automatically made according to the criteria specified for each delivery. For example, I create a rule that specifies a pricing: . | in the department of 93 with cargo bike placed at the top of the pile; | in Paris intramural with cargo bike placed in the middle of the pile; | in intramural Paris placed at the bottom of the pile. | . If a delivery is created involving a series of tasks in Paris intramural with a single bike, then the first rule will be ignored, and the second used as delivery basis. The precise rules (ie with the most variables) must be at the top of the stack and the most general ones at the bottom of the stack so that special cases are selected by the software as a basis for pricing. If, for example, I take my pricing list higher as follows: in intramural paris; in Paris intramural with cargo bike; in the department of 93 with cargo bike. If a delivery is created for intramural Paris with a cargo bike, then the first rule will be ignored. The second corresponds to the delivery, its price will therefore be applied. The second rule being fulfilled, the third is ignored. The most precise rules (i.e. with the most parameters) must be at the top of the stack and the most general rules at the bottom of the stack, so that the specific cases are selected by the software as a basis for pricing. If, for example, I modify the above pricing as follows: . in intramural Paris; in intramural Paris with cargo bike; in the 93 department with cargo bike. If a delivery in intramural Paris is created with the need to deliver by cargo bike, the price specified for the first rule will apply because no type of bike is specified for it and the second will be ignored.

Creating a delivery . To create a delivery, you will need to make a POST request to the /api/deliveries endpoint. A delivery consists of two tasks, a pickup task and a dropoff task. The minimal information we need is the address, and the timeframe of each task. POST /api/deliveries { \"pickup\": { \"address\": \"24, Rue de la Paix, Paris, France\", \"before\": \"tomorrow 12:00\" }, \"dropoff\": { \"address\": \"48, Rue de Rivoli, Paris, France\", \"before\": \"tomorrow 13:30\" } } . If possible, you should provide as much additional information as possible, like the phone number &amp; name of the recipient. There are multiple fields that can be specified. Take a look at our functional tests to learn more about available fields. Tracking the status of a delivery . When the delivery has been created, you obtain a response like below: . { \"@context\":\"/api/contexts/Delivery\", \"@type\":\"http://schema.org/ParcelDelivery\", \"@id\":\"/api/deliveries/123\", \"pickup\": { \"@id\":\"/api/tasks/456\", \"@type\":\"Task\", \"status\":\"TODO\", // ... other fields }, \"dropoff\": { \"@id\":\"/api/tasks/457\", \"@type\":\"Task\", \"status\":\"TODO\", // ... other fields } } . To be able to track the status of the parcel, make sure to store in your system the IRIs of the created resources. Then, you can later poll the API to know if the tasks have been completed. GET /api/tasks/456 { \"@id\":\"/api/tasks/456\", \"@type\":\"Task\", \"status\":\"DONE\", // ... other fields } . When a task is completed, the status property will change from TODO to DONE. When both tasks are completed, it means the delivery is completed! . ",

Actually, it’s more complicated than that… because there are weekends. For example, let’s say that you configure « 2 days », only during the week (from Monday to Friday). On Saturdays, the user will still be allowed to choose time ranges on Monday and Tuesday. Prior Notice . The Prior Notice setting allows to decide how much time in advance the user will be allowed to choose a time range. For example, let’s say that you configure a time range from 4PM to 6PM, with a 2 hours prior notice. It means that the user will be able to select the 4PM-6PM time range until 2PM. Same Day Cutoff .
