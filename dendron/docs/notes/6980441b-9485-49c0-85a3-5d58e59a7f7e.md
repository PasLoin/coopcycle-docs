# Management of users

The list of administrators is available in the page `Users`. This list describes accounts which are inscribed on the platform and their associated informations. It also enables to add/create a new user.

## User profil

It is possible to activate/desactivate users. A desactivated user is disconnected and can't access the platform anymore.
